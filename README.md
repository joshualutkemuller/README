Hi There!

Seasoned investment professional with a full-stack data science skill set (Python, R, SQL, SAS and PowerBi/Tableau for DataViz) that I use to enhance corporate decision making. I have the ability to approach problems and dilemmas with a viewpoint influenced by my diverse public and military experience.

Vast experience with leading data projects and building dashboards for various business groups across the organization. In addition, I have built and trained various text mining, pricing models, valuation models and data scrubbing models to fit the need of different business groups.

I have vast professional experience building pricing models, valuation models, scripting models, alternative data scraping models, and other quantitative tools using both R and Python.

Recent Python Projects :
- Built various consumer loan pricing models leveraging both build up approaches and the secant method
- Developed a dynamic credit union competitive analysis model that loads quarterly call reports and allows for dynamic ranking based on existing fields or user defined fields.
- Developed an automated compiler that reads each daily field going back the amount of months set by the user and compiles the data into one readable dataset that allows for intuitive trending and threshold analysis.
- Developed a CMO Model that analyzes the risk-adjusted yields based on the SDA prepayment methodology.
- Developed a Python webscraper that navigates through daily balance & collateral data and feeds into a dashboard which allows for these additional KPIs to be tracked in a centralized fashion.
- Developed a web scraping model that sources several key rates (CMTs, Daily Par Treasuries, Real Yields, Fed Funds, and FHLB curves) and develops term structure by leveraging linear interpolation programmatically which serves as the base input for all of the institutions pricing models

My academic background consists of a B.S. in Economics and a M.S. in Financial Economics from Texas A&M University. In addition, I have been studying data analytics for the three years and have earned the DataCamp Data Science Career Track accomplishment as well as the Google Professional Data Analytics Certification. CFA Charter earned in 2021.

I have a passion for both the practical and theoretical aspects of investments, data analysis, risk management, and corporate finance, and I thrive in an environment that has a steep learning curve and requires problem-solving skills.
